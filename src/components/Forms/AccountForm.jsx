// This component is a form for account information. This component should render a form for customers to modify their username, password, customer name (if thats something we want to include), and optionally profile pic. Not sure yet if I want to include payment information directly onto this form, or have it be somewhere else.

// This component COULD become a Modal but not sure how to get them working yet :(
